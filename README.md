# betaVAEImputation

As missing values are frequently present in genomic data, practical methods to handle missing data are necessary for downstream analyses that require complete datasets. In this work, we describe the use of a deep learning framework based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) to impute missing values in transcriptome and methylome data analysis.
